## ðŸŒˆ 1. Core Concept

> **Tailwind CSS** is a **utility-first CSS framework** that provides small, single-purpose classes (like `p-4`, `text-center`) instead of writing traditional CSS rules.  
> Each class directly maps to a single CSS property.

Example:
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">Click Me</button>
